Projects

**1. AadharPanLink Application**
**Description:** This is a Core Java-based project designed to verify if a given PAN (Permanent Account Number) is linked to a specific Aadhaar number. The program checks the relationship between the two identifiers and returns whether they are linked or not. This can be useful for compliance with government regulations or personal verification needs.

**2. FindMyTrain Application**
**Description:**This Core Java-based project is designed to help users find  train information, such as train schedules, availability, and station details. Users can search for trains based on the starting and destination stations and get live data about train timings, platform numbers, and seat availability. The project aims to simplify train journey planning and tracking.
